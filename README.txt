# WELCOME
  The following is a guide to 'D&DBattleDice', developed by Maria Koudounakou.

# INSTALLATION
  Invite my bot to your server via the following URL:
    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=804982878139318302&scope=bot&permissions=8

# DOCUMENTATION
  To get started, send "&_help" within a discord text channel where the bot is also a member.

# ABOUT
  Create a profile for each of your D&D characters (outlining class
  features, magical weapon effects, spells.. etc) and this bot will
  intuitively calculate your battle dice each turn and find away to
  deal maximum damage whilst keeping track on the resource cost and
  effects duration.
